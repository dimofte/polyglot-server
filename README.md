## Ultra simple Express boilerplate with Gulp

This is a simple project I use when I need to do some experiment on some js or css.

Gulp gives the livereload super quick power.

### To install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MadeOnMars/Express-boilerplate.git myApp
cd myApp
npm install
npm install --global gulp
gulp
# The project is available at http://localhost:3000
```
